# network_packet_inspection

Linux-based C++ network packet inspection that parses TCP/IP traffic and detects suspicious network behavior.

## Requirements

This project requires:

- C++20 compiler
- CMake
- Ninja
- libpcap

## Install Dependencies

On Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux systems, install the required tools with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build libpcap-dev
```

## How to Build and Run

This project uses CMake and Ninja.

### 1. Configure the build

From the project root, run:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
```

### 2. Build the project

```bash
cmake --build build
```

### 3. Find your network interface

Before running the program, find the name of the network interface you want to capture packets from:

```bash
ip link
```

Example interface names may include:

```text
wlp2s0f0
wlan0
eth0
enp0s3
```

### 4. Run the program

Packet capture usually requires elevated permissions, so run the executable with `sudo` and provide the interface name as an argument:

```bash
sudo ./build/NetworkPacketInspection <interface-name>
```

Example:

```bash
sudo ./build/NetworkPacketInspection wlp2s0f0
```

## How It Works

The program captures live network traffic from a specified interface and processes each packet through a structured pipeline.

### Flow

1. The program starts and takes a network interface as input  
2. A `PacketInspectionService` object is created to manage the system  
3. Packet capture begins using libpcap  
4. Each captured packet triggers a callback function (`packetHandler`)  
5. The raw packet data is copied into a `RawPacket` object  
6. The packet is pushed into a thread-safe queue (`PacketQueue`) for processing
